We wrote tests only for the functions we've implenented, that's why total coverage is 38%. 
The com.cardio_generator.outputs package has relatively low test coverage, particularly for TcpOutputStrategy and WebSocketOutputStrategy.
These classes involve networking, which is more challenging to test with JUnit, and we havenâ€™t yet learned how to do that effectively.
All other packages and classes have been tested thoroughly and have good coverage.
